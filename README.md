This repository hosts a microservices-based online car dealership application, designed to facilitate the sale of cars through a modern and user-friendly web platform. The application architecture leverages Java as the primary programming language, along with a suite of Spring Framework technologies including Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, and Spring Web for robust server-side development. Maven is utilized as the project management and build automation tool, ensuring seamless dependency management and project configuration. MySQL is employed as the relational database management system to store and manage data efficiently.

On the client side, the application utilizes Angular framework along with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. Node.js is utilized for server-side JavaScript runtime environment, enabling efficient handling of asynchronous tasks and event-driven architecture.

Key Technologies Used:

Java & Spring Framework: Powering the server-side development, providing comprehensive support for building scalable and maintainable microservices.
Angular Framework: Facilitating the development of interactive and dynamic user interfaces, enhancing the user experience of the online car dealership platform.
MySQL: Serving as the backend database for storing and managing car listings, user data, and transaction records.
Node.js: Used for server-side JavaScript runtime, enabling efficient handling of client requests and server-side operations.
Maven: Employed for project management and build automation, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds across different environments.

Features:
